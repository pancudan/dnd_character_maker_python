**Dungeons & Dragons Character Sheet Generator (dnd_character_maker_python)**

This Python script automates the creation of character sheets for Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) 5th edition. It provides a user-friendly interface for generating unique character sheets, streamlining the character creation process for players and Dungeon Masters.

**Requirements**

* Python 3.x (Download: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* `dungeonsdragons.xlsx` (External Excel document containing character generation data)

**Features**

* **Randomized Character Creation:** Offers a variety of options for generating backgrounds, races, classes, and religions. Users can create unique characters or randomize the process entirely.
* **Ability Score Generation:** Randomly assigns ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) in accordance with D&D rules.
* **Character Sheet Display and Save:** Displays the generated character sheet on the console for review and allows optional saving to a text file named "character_sheet.txt" for future reference.
* **Multiple Script Versions:** Provides three distinct versions catering to different user preferences or functionalities.
